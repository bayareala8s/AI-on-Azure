### Azure AI Language services

Sure, here are some real-world examples of using Azure AI Language services in Python:

1. **Extract Information (Named Entity Recognition)**: Extracting key phrases or entities from a text using Text Analytics API.

```python
from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient, TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential

client = TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint="<your-text-analytics-endpoint>", credential=TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential("<your-text-analytics-key>"))

documents = ["Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975."]
response = client.recognize_entities(documents=documents)[0]

print("Named Entities:")
for entity in response.entities:
    print("\tText: \t", entity.text, "\tCategory: \t", entity.category, "\tSubCategory: \t", entity.subcategory)
```

2. **Summarize Text-Based Content**: Azure AI doesn't provide a direct service for text summarization. However, you can use a combination of services like key phrase extraction and entity recognition to create a summary.

3. **Classify Text (Text Classification)**: Classifying text into predefined categories using custom classifiers in Language Understanding (LUIS).

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.language.luis.runtime import LUISRuntimeClient
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

runtime_endpoint = "<your-luis-runtime-endpoint>"
runtime_key = "<your-luis-runtime-key>"
app_id = "<your-luis-app-id>"

client = LUISRuntimeClient(runtime_endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(runtime_key))

def predict(client):
    request = { "query" : "turn on the lights" }
    response = client.prediction.get_slot_prediction(app_id, "Production", request)
    print("Top intent: {}".format(response.prediction.top_intent))

predict(client)
```

4. **Answer Questions (QnA Maker)**: Building a question-answering system from your semi-structured content like FAQ documents, URLs, and product manuals.

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.knowledge.qnamaker import QnAMakerClient
from azure.cognitiveservices.knowledge.qnamaker.models import QnAMakerRuntimeClient, QueryDTO
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

runtime_endpoint = "<your-qna-maker-runtime-endpoint>"
runtime_key = "<your-qna-maker-runtime-key>"
knowledge_base_id = "<your-knowledge-base-id>"

client = QnAMakerRuntimeClient(runtime_endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(runtime_key))

def get_answer(client):
    question = QueryDTO(question="What is Azure?")
    response = client.runtime.generate_answer(knowledge_base_id, question)
    print("Answer: {}".format(response.answers[0].answer))

get_answer(client)
```

5. **Understand Conversations (LUIS)**: Understanding user's intent in a conversation using Language Understanding (LUIS).

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.language.luis.runtime import LUISRuntimeClient
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

runtime_endpoint = "<your-luis-runtime-endpoint>"
runtime_key = "<your-luis-runtime-key>"
app_id = "<your-luis-app-id>"

client = LUISRuntimeClient(runtime_endpoint, CognitiveServicesCredentials(runtime_key))

def predict(client):
    request = { "query" : "Book a flight to New York" }
    response = client.prediction.get_slot_prediction(app_id, "Production", request)
    print("Top intent: {}".format(response.prediction.top_intent))
    print("Entities: {}".format(response.prediction.entities))

predict(client)
```

6. **Translate Text (Translator Text API)**: Translating text from one language to another using Translator Text API.

```python
from azure.cognitiveservices.language.translatortext import TranslatorTextClient
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

client = TranslatorTextClient("<your-translator-text-endpoint>", CognitiveServicesCredentials("<your-translator-text-key>"))

def translate_text(client):
    response = client.translate(["Hello, how are you?"], to=['fr'])
    for result in response:
        for translation in result.translations:
            print("Translated to: ", translation.to, " Text: ", translation.text)

translate_text(client)
```

Remember to replace `"<your-text-analytics-endpoint>"`, `"<your-text-analytics-key>"`, `"<your-luis-runtime-endpoint>"`, `"<your-luis-runtime-key>"`, `"<your-luis-app-id>"`, `"<your-qna-maker-runtime-endpoint>"`, `"<your-qna-maker-runtime-key>"`, `"<your-knowledge-base-id>"`, `"<your-translator-text-endpoint>"`, and `"<your-translator-text-key>"` with your actual service keys and endpoints.

### Limitations of using Azure AI Language services

Azure AI Language services, like any other technology, have their own set of limitations. Here are some of them:

1. **Rate Limits**: Azure AI Language services have rate limits. For instance, the Text Analytics API has a limit of 1000 documents per request and 5000 records per minute for the free tier. If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429` error code indicating that you've exceeded the rate limit.

2. **Text Size Limits**: There are also limitations on the size of the text that can be processed. For example, the Text Analytics API can process documents up to 5120 characters long.

3. **Language Support**: While Azure AI Language services support multiple languages, not all languages are supported for all features. For example, entity recognition is not available for all languages.

4. **Training Time**: Training a Language Understanding (LUIS) model can take a significant amount of time, especially for larger models. This could potentially slow down the development process.

5. **Data Privacy**: When using these services, your data is sent to Azure's servers for processing. This might not be suitable for applications that require high levels of data privacy.

6. **Cost**: While Azure provides a free tier for many of its AI services, costs can escalate quickly with heavy usage. It's important to monitor usage to avoid unexpected charges.

7. **Dependency**: There is a dependency on the internet and Azure's uptime. If Azure experiences downtime or if the internet connection is lost, the services will not be available.

8. **Customization**: While Azure AI Language services offer a wide range of capabilities, there might be specific use cases that are not covered. In such cases, you might need to build custom models or use other tools.

Remember, these limitations are subject to change as Microsoft continues to update and improve Azure AI Language services. Always refer to the official Azure documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
